# Cumulocity IoT Runtime Widget Loader
Load [packaged](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-runtime-widget) Cumulocity IoT custom widgets at runtime, rather than by recompiling your whole application or you can create IoT custom widget with runtime widget loading support by following [Demo Widget](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-demo-widget).

## Widget Installation
**Requires:** Application upload permission (usually admin rights)

1. While on a dashboard screen, select the `More...` -> `Install Widget` option in the action bar
2. Upload a runtime widget zip file (Created using the [Runtime Widget Template](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-runtime-widget))
3. Start using your widget

## Builds

### Using the Application Builder?
This is already included in the latest version of the [Application Builder](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-app-builder)

### Want to add Runtime Widgets to the Cumulocity IoT Cockpit?
Pick one of the pre-built images available in the [Releases Area](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-runtime-widget-loader/releases).


## Build Instructions
1. (Optional) Create a new Cumulocity IoT web app and initialise it:
   ```
   c8ycli new cockpit cockpit -a @c8y/apps@1006.6.24
   cd cockpit
   npm install
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install jszip webpack-external-import
   ```
   For the 1006.6.0 version of Cumulocity IoT you also need to install a specific version of ngx-bootstrap:
   ```
   npm install ngx-bootstrap@5.5.0
   ```   
3. Grab the Runtime Widget Loader **[Latest Release Binary](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-smart-map-widget/releases/download/1.0.1/gp-smart-map-1.0.1.tgz)**
4. Install the Runtime Widget Loader:
   ```
   npm install <binary file path>/cumulocity-runtime-widget-loader-1006.6.24-1.0.0.tgz
   ```
5. Edit package.json start and build configurations to include an extraWebpackConfig option:
   ```
   {
     ...
     "scripts": {
       "start": "c8ycli server --env.extraWebpackConfig=node_modules/cumulocity-runtime-widget-loader/runtime-widget-webpack.config.js",
       "build": "c8ycli build --env.extraWebpackConfig=node_modules/cumulocity-runtime-widget-loader/runtime-widget-webpack.config.js"
     }
     ...
   }
   ```
6. Update the package.json `"main"` entry to point to `"index.ts"` rather than `"index.js"`:
   ```
   {
     ...
     "main": "index.ts"
     ...
   }
   ```
7. Add cumulocity-runtime-widget-loader to the app.module.ts:
   ```javascript
   import {RuntimeWidgetLoaderService, RuntimeWidgetInstallerModule} from "cumulocity-runtime-widget-loader";
   
   @NgModule({
     imports: [
       ...
       // Adds an "Install widget" button to the action bar when you have a dashboard open.
       // Alternatively, remove the ".forRoot()" and manually invoke the RuntimeWidgetInstallerModalService#show() method
       RuntimeWidgetInstallerModule.forRoot(),
       ...
     ]
   })
   export class AppModule extends HybridAppModule {
     constructor(protected upgrade: NgUpgradeModule, private runtimeWidgetLoaderService: RuntimeWidgetLoaderService) {
       super();
     }
   
     ngDoBootstrap(): void {
       super.ngDoBootstrap();
       // Load the runtime widgets
       // Note: This must be after angularJs is loaded so it is done after bootstrapping
       this.runtimeWidgetLoaderService.loadRuntimeWidgets();
     }
   }

   ```
8. Include patches to webpack-external-import and to @c8y/ngx-components.
   
   Install patch-package:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev patch-package
   ```
   Edit package.json (to reapply a patch after every install):
   ```
   {
     ...
     "scripts": {
       ...
       "postinstall": "patch-package --patch-dir node_modules/cumulocity-runtime-widget-loader/patches"
     }
     ...
   }
   ```
   Install the patch, by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
9. Run the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
